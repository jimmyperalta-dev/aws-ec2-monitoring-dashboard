## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive CloudWatch dashboard to visualize real-time EC2 system metrics using the CloudWatch Agent. The dashboard provides critical performance insights while configurable alarms trigger SNS notifications when resource thresholds are breached.

## üîç Monitored Metrics

- **CPU Usage (Idle %)**  
  Tracks available compute capacity to help identify under- or over-utilization.

- **Memory Usage (%)**  
  Indicates current RAM usage to support troubleshooting and capacity planning.

- **Disk Usage (% and Inodes)**  
  Monitors storage consumption and file system health.

- **Network Traffic**  
  Tracks inbound and outbound network activity.

> 
> DNS resolution handled via Route 53, enabling HTTPS-secured traffic flow from browser to EC2. CloudWatch Agent runs on the EC2 instance, collects metrics (CPU, memory, disk), and publishes them to CloudWatch for real-time monitoring. Alarms notify via SNS when thresholds are breached.

## üõ† Deployment Steps

1. **EC2 Instance Setup**
   - Launched Ubuntu EC2 instance in the free tier with a public IP
   - Attached an IAM role with CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy
   - Configured security groups for SSH access

2. **CloudWatch Agent Configuration**
   - Installed the CloudWatch Agent using the AWS-provided package
   - Created and uploaded custom configuration JSON to collect:
     - CPU usage (user, system, idle, iowait)
     - Memory usage (used, available, cached)
     - Disk usage (used%, inodes)
     - Network metrics (bytes in/out, packets)
   - Configured agent to run as a system service
   - Verified metrics were reporting to CloudWatch namespace `CWAgent`

3. **Dashboard & Alerts Setup**
   - Built a CloudWatch Dashboard with multiple metric widgets
   - Created CPU and memory-based alarms with appropriate thresholds
   - Configured SNS topic and email subscription for alerts
   - Tested alarm functionality by generating load on the instance

- EC2 instance provisioning and access via SSH
- IAM role assignment and permission troubleshooting
- CloudWatch Agent installation and JSON-based configuration
- Log and metric validation via terminal and console
- Alarm setup using metric thresholds and SNS integration
- Dashboard customization in AWS CloudWatch
- System-level monitoring best practices
