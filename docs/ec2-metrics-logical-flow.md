# Logical Flow of the EC2 Metrics Dashboard

## 1. Infrastructure Setup Flow

The deployment process begins with the configuration of the following AWS resources in sequence:

1. **EC2 Instance Provisioning**:
   - Ubuntu 22.04 EC2 instance launched in the free tier
   - Public IP assigned for access
   - Security groups configured to allow necessary traffic
   - SSH key pair created for secure access

2. **IAM Configuration**:
   - IAM role created with CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy
   - Instance profile created for the role
   - Role attached to EC2 instance
   - Permissions verified to ensure proper metric reporting

3. **CloudWatch Agent Installation**:
   - SSH connection established to EC2 instance
   - CloudWatch Agent package downloaded
   - Agent installed via package manager
   - Agent configuration file created with JSON structure
   - Custom configuration applied to collect specific metrics:
     * CPU usage (including idle percentage)
     * Memory usage (percentage)
     * Disk usage (used percentage and inodes)
   - Agent service started and enabled on boot

4. **CloudWatch Dashboard Creation**:
   - Dashboard created in CloudWatch console
   - Widgets added for each metric category
   - Graph types selected based on metric visualization needs
   - Time periods configured for optimal viewing
   - Dashboard layout organized for clear monitoring

5. **Alarm and Notification Setup**:
   - SNS topic created for alarm notifications
   - Email subscription configured and confirmed
   - CloudWatch alarms defined with appropriate thresholds:
     * CPU utilization thresholds
     * Memory usage thresholds
     * Disk space thresholds
   - Alarms linked to SNS topic for notification delivery

## 2. Metric Collection Flow

The metrics flow through the system in this path:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - CloudWatch Agent runs as a service on EC2 instance
   - Agent polls system metrics at defined intervals
   - System metrics gathered:
     * CPU statistics (user, system, idle, etc.)
     * Memory usage (used, available, cached)
     * Disk space (used percentage, free space)
     * Inode usage (percentage used)

2. **Metric Transmission**:
   - Agent aggregates metric data
   - Data formatted according to CloudWatch specifications
   - Metrics published to CloudWatch service using AWS API
   - Authentication handled via IAM role credentials
   - Data sent to custom namespace `CWAgent`

3. **Metric Storage**:
   - CloudWatch receives metrics data
   - Metrics stored with appropriate dimensions
   - Time series database maintains historical data
   - Data retention applied based on CloudWatch settings

## 3. Visualization and Monitoring Flow

The dashboard and monitoring process operates as follows:

1. **User Access**:
   - User accesses CloudWatch dashboard via AWS Console
   - Route 53 handles DNS resolution (if custom domain used)
   - CloudFront provides HTTPS secure connection
   - Authentication via IAM user or role

2. **Dashboard Rendering**:
   - CloudWatch retrieves stored metric data
   - Dashboard loads with configured widgets
   - Metrics displayed as graphs and charts
   - Real-time and historical data presented
   - Auto-refresh updates dashboard at regular intervals

3. **Alarm Processing**:
   - CloudWatch continuously evaluates metrics against alarm thresholds
   - When threshold breached, alarm state changes to ALARM
   - Alarm triggers notification action
   - SNS topic receives notification request
   - Email notification sent to subscribed addresses

## 4. Troubleshooting Flow

The system includes pathways for troubleshooting:

1. **Agent Validation**:
   - Agent status checked via service command
   - Configuration file validated for correct syntax
   - Log files examined for error messages
   - Test metrics published to verify functionality
   - Agent restarted if necessary

2. **Metric Verification**:
   - CloudWatch console used to check metric presence
   - Raw metric data viewed to confirm collection
   - Namespace and dimensions verified
   - Metric statistics compared with system tools (top, htop)

3. **Alarm Testing**:
   - Test alarms created with artificially low thresholds
   - Alarm transitions observed in console
   - Notification delivery confirmed via email
   - Alarm history reviewed for proper functioning

## 5. Security Flow

Security measures are implemented throughout:

1. **Access Control**:
   - IAM roles with least privilege principle
   - Security groups restricting network access
   - SSH key-based authentication
   - AWS Console access controlled via IAM policies

2. **Data Protection**:
   - HTTPS encryption for all AWS API communications
   - CloudFront TLS encryption for dashboard access
   - Secure storage of metrics data within CloudWatch
   - SNS encryption for notification delivery

3. **Audit and Logging**:
   - CloudTrail logs for API activity
   - EC2 instance logs for system events
   - CloudWatch Agent logs for troubleshooting
   - SNS delivery logs for notification tracking

This monitoring architecture demonstrates the integration of EC2 instances with CloudWatch for comprehensive system visibility. The implementation provides real-time awareness of resource utilization, enabling proactive management and issue resolution through automated alerting.
